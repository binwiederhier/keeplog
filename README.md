keeplog
--
**keeplog** is a simple two-way synchronization tool to sync a local daily log with [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com). 
When run, keeplog parses the local file and synchronizes each entry to individual Keep notes. Updates within Keep are 
populated to the local file as well.

I mainly wrote it to learn Python and to support my workflow: I keep a local file in `~/LOG` with one entry 
per day, like this:

```
11/5/20 Friday
--
Todo
- More stuff

11/8/20 Sunday
--
Done
- Stuff
``` 

I love the simplicity of a single text file and I absolutely hate the Google Keep UI in the browser. My notes are very
extensive and often include code, so I like my text editor much more. But naturally, text files don't sync well, which 
is why keeplog exists -- so I can access and edit my notes from my phone if I have a brilliant idea and I'm not at 
the computer.

Installation
--
1. Create a [Google App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) for keeplog
2. Create a config file `~/.keeplog/config` from [this template](config). Be sure to edit at least 
   `user=`, `pass=` and `file=`.
3. Install dependencies via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Optionally (but highly recommended), you may either regularly run `keeplog.py sync` as a cron, or `keeplog.py watch` 
   as a long running process, such as a systemd user service:
   
```
$ vi ~/.config/systemd/user/keeplog.service
[Unit]
Description=Keeplog watch daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/keeplog/keeplog.py watch
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

$ systemctl enable --user keeplog
$ systemctl start --user keeplog
$ journalctl --user -f -u keeplog
``` 

Usage
--
keeplog has two commands:

- `keeplog.py sync` synchronizes local file with Google Keep
- `keeplog.py watch` monitors the local file for changes and syncs when changed

Manually (or via cron):

```
$ ./keeplog.py sync
2020-11-08 13:33:50,038 [INFO] Logging in with token
2020-11-08 13:33:59,221 [INFO] Successfully logged in
2020-11-08 13:33:59,221 [INFO] Comparing remote and local
2020-11-08 13:33:59,234 [INFO] - Updating locally: 11/5/20 Friday

2020-11-08 13:33:59,616 [INFO] Writing local notes
```

Using file system monitoring:

```
$ ./keeplog.py watch
2020-11-08 21:55:23,901 [INFO] Watching local log file for changes
2020-11-08 21:55:31,728 [INFO] File modified, triggering sync
