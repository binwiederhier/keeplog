# Your daily log file. That's the file you use update every day.
# The file has a very specific (but simple) format.
#
# Format:
#   11/1/20 Sunday
#   --
#   Some text
#
# Please note that the log entry title is used as the identifier for the post.
# It should not be changed. The filename can contain "~" which expand to the
# home directory, e.g. ~/LOG. This setting is MANDATORY.
#
# file=

# Label to be used in Keep to identify relevant entries
#
# label=keeplog

# State file: This file is used to to store
# - checksums of the last synchronization run
# - the internal Keep state (to facitilate a faster login)
# - the Keep master token (to avoid password-based logins)
#
# state-file=~/.keeplog/state

# Conflict strategy: Decides what happens if local and remote
# are edited at the same time:
#
# - do-nothing (default): Just reports conflicts in the output
# - prefer-local: Overwrites changes in Google Keep
# - prefer-remote: Overwrites changes in the local log file
#
# on-conflict=do-nothing

# Backup directory for local LOG files. Every time the local file is updated due
# to a remote change, the current local file is copied to this directory. Every time
# the remote notes are changed, a backup of the local changes are made.
#
# backup-dir=~/.keeplog/backups

# Interval in seconds to sync if no local changes are detected.
# This is an integer setting and is only used in in the `keeplog watch` command.
#
# watch-interval=60

# Delay in seconds to wait after changes were detected before a sync is triggered.
# This is a float setting and is only used in in the `keeplog watch` command.
#
# watch-sync-delay=3.0

# Error strategy for watch errors: Decides what happens if there is any error
# when watching the daily log file (e.g. Internet connectivity issues, or inotify errors):
#
# - exit (default): Exits the script with error code 1. This can be used if systemd (or other
#                   mechanisms) restart the script automatically.
# - retry: Re-establishes the watch in an infinite retry mechanism. This was somewhat unstable
#          when the Internet fails and comes back and leads to infinite failures.
#
# on-watch-error=exit
