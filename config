# Conflict strategy: Decides what happens if local and remote
# are edited at the same time:
#
# - prefer-local (default): Overwrites changed in Google Keep
# - prefer-remote: Overwrites changed in the local log file
# - do-nothing: Just reports conflicts in the output
#
# on-conflict=do-nothing

# Backup directory for local LOG files. Every time the local file is updated due
# to a remote change, the current local file is copied to this directory.
